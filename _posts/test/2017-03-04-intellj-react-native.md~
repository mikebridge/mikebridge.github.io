- Download and install [IntelliJ Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition).  Use the 30-day evaluation and buy it.  It's cheap and it's the best development tool anywhere.  The community version is also great, but it lacks some essential pieces like JavaScript/TypeScript tools.

- Follow the [IntelliJ instructions for installing the Android SDK Tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/prerequisites-for-android-development.html)

It isn't clear from the instructions, but you need to download the [SDK tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), not the full Android Studio.  Once you've downloaded e.g. `tools_r25.X.X-windows.zip`, unzip it somewhere and run `tools/android.bat`.
