      <description>I wasted quite a bit of time trying to find the correct way to zip a folder in PowerShell so that it could later be extracted in a Linux docker container.
TLDR; Turns out the standard unix tar command is now standard-issue in Windows—no need to use PowerShell functions at all:
&amp;nbsp;  tar -cvzf myfile.tgz mydir 
Microsoft added this in 2017—nice!
These didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me:
 PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s Compress-Archive generates Windows path-separators, which Alpine/BusyBox&amp;rsquo;s version of unzip can&amp;rsquo;t handle (though Debian&amp;rsquo;s unzip can).</description>

      <description>Facebook&amp;rsquo;s developers are mostly Apple People, so they don&amp;rsquo;t waste many mental cycles fretting over React-Native developers who are on other platforms. I don&amp;rsquo;t like straying too much from the main path when it comes to deciding on which tools to use, so I wondered if it was advisable—or even possible—to debug React Native at all on Windows. Google Search didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal much information about what Windows React-Native developers do when their app crashes with no error message.</description>

      <description>I fell into a discussion with another soccer-dad last weekend as we watched our own children play indoor soccer about teaching kids to code. I talked about my experiences with Raspberry Pi, Scratch and Sonic Pi at the coding club we set up at my son&amp;rsquo;s school, and I mentioned that after reading Generative Art several years ago I pair-programmed some happy faces with my then-seven-year-old son in Processing:</description>
