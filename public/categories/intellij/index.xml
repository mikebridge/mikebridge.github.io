      <title>I18N in React with Typescript &amp; React-Intl</title>

      <description>Earlier this week I went in search of a React-friendly i18n library and I spent some time experimenting with react-intl. React-intl is based on FormatJS, which is a library for localizing numbers, dates, and strings. My impression is that react-intl is a fairly small, practical library that is written to make i18n unobtrusive for developers.
 Edit, May 1, 2017
Today I&amp;rsquo;m wondering whether it may have been a mistake to adopt react-intl over the alternatives.</description>

      <title>Debugging React Native/Android with IntelliJ on Windows</title>

      <description>Facebook&amp;rsquo;s developers are mostly Apple People, so they don&amp;rsquo;t waste many mental cycles fretting over React-Native developers who are on other platforms. I don&amp;rsquo;t like straying too much from the main path when it comes to deciding on which tools to use, so I wondered if it was advisable—or even possible—to debug React Native at all on Windows. Google Search didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal much information about what Windows React-Native developers do when their app crashes with no error message.</description>
